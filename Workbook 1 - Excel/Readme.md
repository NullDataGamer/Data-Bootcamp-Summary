# Workbook 1 - Data introduction and Excel
## Introduction to data
The first workbook that was completed as a part of the 8 week data skills bootcamp was learning about data and how to use Microsoft Excel functions to read, clean, transform, manipulate and visualise data. 
Using the skills learnt during this first week the workbook was completed to demostrate understanding of the material taught and ability to apply the skills to tasks similar to that you may find in a workplace.

The introduction to data was all about giving a basic understanding into data such as;
  
  - What data is.
  - Different data types.
  - Data laws and regulations.
  - Data security.

This was provided to help ground and center what was learnt to help in the application of the knowledge. 
This was very useful as it contextualised everything that was being taught making it easier to apply it to professional enivronment.
Furthermore learning about the laws and regulations reinforces how serious of a business data is and beind informed about how to protect data and industry best practice solidified the real world ramifications.

The main laws that are most applicable to businesses in the UK are the following;

  - Data Protection Act (2018) - Gives people more control over personal information provided to organisations.
  - General Data Protection Regulation (2018) AKA:GDPR - Strict rules over how data is collected, stored and protected.
  - Freedom of Information Act (2000) - Gives the public the right to access recorded information held by public authorities.
  - Computer Misuse Act (1990) - Laws around using a computer with intent to cause harm. (hacking, creating/spreading malware, DOS attacks etc.)

 ## Excel functions and uses
 After the introduction to data was finished Microsoft Excel was introduced as a very basic but versatile starting point to get used to data cleaning, manipulation and visualisation.
 This started off very simply with tables, basic filtering, graphs and functions (MAX, MEAN, etc.) before ramping into more advanced features like pivot tables, conditional formatting and more advanced functions like switch.

 With these skills it allows for a data analyst to manipulate the data, filter and sort basic data then present it in a way which is easy to understand for a non technical person with a graph or chart.
