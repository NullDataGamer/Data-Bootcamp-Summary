# Steam Game Data (2021-2025) Analysis Project
## Project Kickoff
When trying to decide what to do for my first project I couldn't think of any good ideas.
As I was browsing Kaggle I came across the following dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jypenpen54534/steam-games-dataset-2021-2025-65k). 
This dataset really stood out to me for multiple reasons the main ones being.

1) It is a topic I am knowledgable and passionate about.
2) It is a very large versatile dataset I could manipulate to extract insights.
3) The data was collected from the source making it an accurate source.

## Project Progression
Now I had a dataset and an idea of what I wanted to do I made quick work downloading and investigating the viability of the data.
I found that the dataset was very useable it would just need cleaning as multiple instances of missing values, Null values or inconsistent entries.
After cleaning the data by removing blank entries, resolving data format issues I decided to add conditional columns to allow for more in depth analysis.
The columns I wanted to add the most were the following;

1) Season of release
2) Price bands

With those conditional columns created it would allow me to create slicers to break the data down further later on.
Once I was done cleaning and transforming the data I could finally begin visualising and analysing the data.
I decided to start with a universal chart that I could use as a baseline to make sure any other charts created didn't give anomalous answers.
The first chart created was a simple bar chart showing the 25 most popular games released during the timeframe shown below.
