# Tableau and PowerBI
## Data Visualisation
The first thing introduced was data visualisation this included the varying types of charts and graphs and the recommended uses for each.
Now with a basic understanding of the varying types of charts and graphs along with industry best practices for layout and format, Tableau and PowerBU were introduced.
For each of those software data cleaning, transformation and visualisation was shown (where applicaable).
Based on that the workbooks provided along with data sets which were completed a few intresting findings are listed below.

## Tableau
The first Tableau dataset was about the employment rate change in the UK.
After compiling the data and creating various graphs and charts the main finding was that outside of London, Brighton and Nottingham had the largest change in the UK by a significant margin.
The Graph shown below demonstrates this with a map of the UK and the change in employment shown by the size of the bubble.

The second Tableau dataset was about Spotify music.
There was many metrics included such as Tempo, Dancability, Listen time, Length etc...
After compiling the data an intresting fact stood out and that was Nobuo Uematsu was the third most popular artist despite Anime music only making up 2.3% of the listen time.
This suggests that Anime music may have an untapped audience and it may be worth suggesting it to more people using Nobuo Uematsu as a gateway to the genre.

The final Tableau dataset was a collection of health metrics worldwide.
After analysing the data the following trends were found:
  - Europe has the highest average life expectancy.
  - Africa has the lowest average life expectancy.
  - Tonga has the highest average BMI.
  - Bangaladesh has the lowest average BMI.

Focusing on the UK some interesting trends were discovered.
For example in the UK BMI is increasing year on year however blood pressure and cholesterol are decreasing so it should be recommended that this is monitored to prevent a sudden spike.
The trends are shown in the bar charts below comparing the three points of interest.

## PowerBI
PowerBI has more advanced features than Tableau allowing the user to transform the data, add new columns, add relational models and create dashboards.
The workbook tasks provided for PowerBI required using the microsoft learning courses "Get data in PowerBI" (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-data/?source=learn), "Clean transform and load data in PowerBI" (https://microsoftlearning.github.io/PL-300-Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst/Instructions/Labs/02-transform-data-power-bi.html#lab-story) and "Design a Report in PowerBI Desktop" (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/power-bi-effective-reports/).
Task 1 required the completion of "Get data in PowerBI" this lab was mostly about loading datasets into PowerBI and the completion proof is shown below.

Task 2 required slightly more work to complete "Clean transform and load data in PowerBI" as the dataset had some issues such as Null or missing values or incorrect data types.
These all needed to be corrected to complete the task requiring the use of the column health features and other tools.
The completion of task 2 is shown below.

Task 3 required the completion of the lab "Design a report in PowerBI desktop" the dataset provided was already cleaned all that was required was to complete a dashboard. The dashboard included a dropdown list (year) and the ability to select options to alter the charts on the page (Country).
The proof of completion of this task is shown below.
