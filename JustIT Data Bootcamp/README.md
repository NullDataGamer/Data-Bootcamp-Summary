# Data Bootcamp Summary
A summary of the 5 technical workbooks completed to demonstrate the skills learnt during the 8 week data skills bootcamp with JustIT. 
Each folder in this repository contains a summary of what was learnt, the completed workbook and a brief screenshot from the file demostrating a key skill learnt. 
Each folder will contain only 1 workbook but may have more than one topic, for example Workbook 2 covers Tableau and PowerBI. 
Therefore multiple screenshots for context will be used to demonstrate key skills for each software used to complete the workbooks. 

The Workbooks covered the following topics:
  - Excel
  - Tableau and PowerBI
  - Databases and SQL
  - Azure Services and Cloud computing
  - Python

The topics I found the most interesting were Python, databases and PowerBI. 
The main reason I enjoyed learning about these topics in the versatility of them as Python allows you to manipulate dataframes however you want as long as you know how.
Therefore I could create some interesting projects and ideas using Python as the main tool as I felt very limited with SQL on what I could do.
So I am excited to use it more and get more comfortable with its syntax and language.
