# Databases and SQL
## Introduction to Databases and relational models
The introduction to databases was very detailed as there are many different types of data store and relational models you can use. 
To begin with basic terms were introduced such as keys, schema and fields.
This was followed by entity descriptions, identifiers (primary key) and even more complex composite primary key.
Next was relationships and various examples of each type before moving onto database structure and linking tables.


## Databases and SQL
After being introduced to the base knowledge required to create a database more advanced functions were introduced for example where a non-relational model would benefit a buisness.
This was followed by JOIN functions and the many different join types you can do with SQL for combining tables within the database.
The main workbook task was to create a database model and recommendations for a small business summed up in a 500 word essay provided in the workbook.
Below is a screenshot of the relational database model found in the workbook.

The following task in the workbook was to use varying SQL commands to extract data from a provided database.
These started out with simple SELECT and SORT commands but got more complex joining multiple tables to allow for more complex searches.
The most interesting task for me in this section was task 10 to sort a list of cities in alphabetical order but only show unique values as shown below.
